### Hi there 👋 I'am currently learning at Spiced Academy 🌿🌶️

I'm Tillmann, a full stack web developer with a background in literature, publishing and creative writing, and based in Berlin. 

Since the past two years I am step by step moving from building websites with or withoung cms to full stack web development. Currently I am learning at spiced academy in Berlin. 

## code by day books by night

Experienced in **managing** large-scale events like festivals in **teams** that work hard and stay relaxed 🚂

I am an ex-language teacher and enjoy working with others - and yes, it is true, as a teacher your learn more than you teach 👨‍🏫

When not coding I am a poet, translator, and editor of **poetry** and used to work with text ✍️
