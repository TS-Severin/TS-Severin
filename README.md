### Hi there 👋 I'am one of the new coriander spicedlings 🌿🌶️

I am a poet and editor of **poetry** and used to work with beautiful text ✍️

which is **fun** to read and some times **difficult** to understand 🤩🏋

now I learn to **code** which sounds pretty much the same 🤖

## What I like
- how css and html work together 🤝
- the way javascript returns functions ♾️
- black cats 😻
