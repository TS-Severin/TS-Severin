### Hi there 👋 

I'm Tillmann (he/him), a **web developer**. Currently, I am working self-employed and create websites or help others restructure their websites in different CMS' and frameworks.

Here are some examples of my work you don't find in my repositories (at least not publicly):
- Build with [grav](https://getgrav.org/): Website for the Startup [GleamShard](https://gleamshard.com/)
- Build with Wordpress 2024: Personal website for the writer [Christine Koschmieder](https://christinekoschmieder.de/)
- Restructured Squarespace page including Landingpage written in CSS: Personal website for the writer [Heidi Saeveraid](https://heidisaevareid.com/)

I passed the [**Web development bootcamp at Spiced Academy**](https://www.spiced-academy.com/de/program/full-stack-web-development) in Winter 2023/24. Before doing that I worked with **Wordpress** and learned HTML and CSS with **codecademy**.

My creative background in literature and my experience in event management and as a language teacher help me understand client's needs, present outcomes, and work with others in teams. 

## Coding in teams

Experienced in **managing** large-scale events like festivals in **teams** that work hard and stay relaxed 🚂

As an ex-language teacher and enjoy **working with others** - and yes, it is true, as a teacher your learn more than you teach 👨‍🏫

When not coding I run a garage **publishing** house for poetry or write myself ✍️

## What I like
- how solutions to coding problems come unexpected - when I am bouldering, swimming, or talking with friends about the novel I just finished 🧗‍♂️
- how different frameworks and languages rely on a similar structure ♾️
- how cats solve problems when food is involved 😻
